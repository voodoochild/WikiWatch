# WikiWatch

This project comprises two parts; a Chrome browser extension which reports whenever you are viewing an article on Wikipedia, and a Django site which accepts and processes the URLs passed from the Chrome extension. The aim is to keep a log of all articles visited, per user, and then to display that data in an interesting way.
